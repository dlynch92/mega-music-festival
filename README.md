# Mega Music Festival

Mega Music Festival is a music festival in the UK - the website is designed both to advertise the festival and provide useful information for people who are already interested.

The index page shows the announced bands via a poster as well as some information on the festival and a google maps iframe to assist in locating the festival premises.Tickets are distributed via a waitlist on the ticket page that users can enter their details on and specify how many tickets they want, with information regarding the outcome provided to them at a later date. There is also a gallery page featuring images from past editions of the festival.

Links to social media are on the footer of each page where users can contact the festival organisers with any queries they may have.
