                    <h3>The fastest growing festival in the UK!</h3>
                    <p class="body-text-font">This will be our fourth year at Mega Music Fest, comparatively few compared to other festivals, but we've already proven what an incredible show we can put on and from the reaction it seems like you agree. We're the fastest growing festival in the UK and we don't have any plans to slow down - so come along for the ride and experience a weekend full of heavy metal and industrial music that's sure to rock your world. </p><br>

                    <h3>Family owned and community driven!</h3>
                    <p class="body-text-font">We're not owned by some big corporation and we're not only out here to make some money - we're a small family business who are in this for the love of the music, and we could never be where we are today without you. The metal community is an incredible one and we want to give back in the only way we know how: by putting on an incredible show. 2024 will be an unmissable year, don't miss out! </p><br>
