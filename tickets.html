        <h3>Why a waitlist?</h3>
        <p>Our tickets last year sold out almost instantly and while we vastly increased the size of the venue to
            accomodate, we've also booked an even bigger lineup so we expect to sell out again. After taking your
            feedback on board we have decided this year to have people show their interest by
            submitting their details to a waitlist - we'll be in touch next month to tell you whether you were
            successful or not, and if you are we will provide you with a link to purchase the tickets. Any tickets that
            are allocated but not purchased will go on general sale - the date of which will be announced at a later
            date.</p><br>
        <p>Please enter your details below. Maximum of 4 tickets requested per person. Tickets aren't guaranteed and no
            payment will be taken today.</p>
